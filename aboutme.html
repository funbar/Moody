                            The data sources that I used were from Weather Underground's API and Spotify's API. Wunderground's API 
                            allowed me to inject a zipcode and grab all the information for that zipcode. However, it did not list the weather,
                            but rather, listed a list of towns within the area. So, I had to make a second query call to the api by creating a 
                            separate link that needed the country and the city name in order to grab the weather. With this, I was able to grab 
                            the temperature and condition fields within the second API call. As for the Spotify API, at first, it only returned
                            information for the users and their playlists, but it never was able to directly print out any kind of playlist. 
                            I simply took a Spotify widget and created a "src" for that iframe and injected the newly created API link that was 
                            generated after a search query for playlists. As for the <strong>Framework</strong>, I refrained from using anything
                            crazy such as Bootstrap, or jQuery because I wanted to build the app up from the ground myself. I could've easily used
                            Angular or Meteor (I have experience with both of these) but wanted to do something more with the css. I used a framework
                            called 'Frow' and it allowed me to style the flex boxes with ease and allows grids to be created easier. I knew it would
                            be good for this project because boxes are normally a great way to display data. I also wanted to use this CSS framework
                            because it was something that I never used before.
