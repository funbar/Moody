                            The data sources that I used were from Weather Underground's API and Spotify's API. Wunderground's API 
                            allowed me to inject a zipcode and grab all the information for that zipcode. However, it did not list the weather,
                            but rather, listed a list of towns within the area. So, I had to make a second query call to the api by creating a 
                            separate link that needed the country and the city name in order to grab the weather. With this, I was able to grab 
                            the temperature and condition fields within the second API call. As for the Spotify API, at first, it only returned
                            information for the users and their playlists, but it never was able to directly print out any kind of playlist. 
                            I simply took a Spotify widget and created a "src" for that iframe and injected the newly created API link that was 
                            generated after a search query for playlists. As for the <strong>Framework</strong>, I refrained from using anything
                            crazy such as Bootstrap, or jQuery because I wanted to build the app up from the ground myself. I could've easily used
                            Angular or Meteor (I have experience with both of these) but wanted to do something more with the css. I used a framework
                            called 'Frow' and it allowed me to style the flex boxes with ease and allows grids to be created easier. I knew it would
                            be good for this project because boxes are normally a great way to display data.

                            This project took me probably 20+ hours to do. Most of it was just learning the API calls and the framework that I 
                            was using for the first time. I've also never built a web app from the ground up, so that took a lot of time too. 
                            I learned a lot of discipline and styling as a result and makes me rely on other pre-built things much less. The step
                            that really took me the longest was thinking about which APIs would be the best to use. I didn't want to build something 
                            that already existed, but I also wanted to make something that would potentially be something that I could use and show off
                            to others. After picking my APIs, I went right to work with getting the first page 'working', and then went to create a header
                            bar. From there, I created skeleton code for the rest of the pages, just to conceive their existence. Then, I took a lot of 
                            time messing with API calls and went to work on the HTML for the other pages, with CSS and JS following after that. The challenges
                            were getting weird responses from the API calls and running into hurdles when dealing with basic HTML things. Ex: having an API 
                            make a call when the user doesn't input data into a form/box.
